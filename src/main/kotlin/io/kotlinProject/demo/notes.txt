1. What is `Gradle`?: build-automation tool
2. `gradlew` is for case when we're in the project
with a specific version of gradle whilst `gradle`
requires it to be installed on the machine.
PS: but sometimes you need to run `./gradlew` so as to tell
gradlew to use folder in the current dir
3. To run the app we can: `./gradlew bootRun`
4. Another way to run the app:
    4.1 compile in JAR: `./gradlew bootJar`
    4.2 java -jar build\libs\_____ where __
        takes JAR file
5.  To create && run docker image:
    5.1`./gradlew bootBuildImage` would assemble a
    docker image
    5.2 `docker run ____` where __ is the name of
        an image
6. `find ~/.gradle -type f -name "*.lock" -delete` is a command to remove current thread that locks new one to start
